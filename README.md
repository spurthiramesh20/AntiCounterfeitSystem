# AntiCounterfeitSystem

AntiCounterfeitSystem is a blockchain-based web application developed as part of a final year engineering project. It is designed to detect and prevent counterfeit product distribution through secure product registration and verification mechanisms.

## Project Overview

The system leverages blockchain technology to provide a tamper-proof record of product data. Each product is registered by the manufacturer and given a unique identifier. Users can scan a code on the product to verify its authenticity using data stored on the blockchain.

## Features

- Secure product registration by authorized manufacturers
- Product verification using QR code or unique identifier
- Blockchain integration for immutable records
- Admin portal to manage product data
- Simple, responsive user interface for end users

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Python (Flask)
- Blockchain: Ethereum (Ganache, Web3.py)
- Smart Contracts: Solidity
- Database: JSON-based or MongoDB (optional)

## My Contributions

- Developed the backend logic and API using Flask
- Integrated Web3.py for blockchain interaction
- Wrote and deployed smart contracts using Solidity
- Built the admin and user interface for product verification
- Conducted end-to-end testing and structured the final project for deployment
